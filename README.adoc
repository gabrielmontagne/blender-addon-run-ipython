Run IPython from Blender
========================

Requires Blender's Python to have access to IPython, either by using your system's Python, or by adding your module folders to `sys.path`

To use: 

* Space to bring up the search, and find 'Run IPython in console'
* On the console from which you started blender, you'll get the IPython console---the UI will stop rendering until you're done, exit the console and return the control to the blender UI.
