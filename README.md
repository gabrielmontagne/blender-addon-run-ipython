# Run IPython from blender

Requires blender to be running in an environment in which IPython is installed.

You should also make blender use your own python (by removing /  renaming your python folder on your install).

To use: 

* space to bring up the search, and find 'Run IPython in console'
* on the console from which you started blender, you'll get the IPython console---the UI will stop/freeze, until you exit and the control comes back to blender.
